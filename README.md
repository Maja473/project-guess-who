# Project Name

This week's project was creating a game of 'Guess Who', where you play against the computer to guess the correct person based on a randomized choice.

## The problem

JavaScript has, in general, been quite difficult to understand so far since it's a lot at once. I've been having trouble getting the 'play again' button to function even though I can't 
see what I'm missing. This is an issue I noticed a bit too late into the week, so if I had more time I'd have made sure to reach out and ask for help regarding that.
